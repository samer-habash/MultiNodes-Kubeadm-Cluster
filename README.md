This is an automated vagrant2.2+VirutalBox5.2 setup for creating kubeadm kubernetes .

The project was modified and rebuilt in order to install 1 Master node and two slave nodes for learning purposes from your machine.

Please note that I am using Ubuntu18.04 image from vagrant.

If you are using machine MacOS or Windows , there will be changes only in installing the docker and kubeadm,kubelete and kubectl .

My localmachine runs on ubuntu 18.04 which I wrote the code to create 3 VMs .

You can change the slave nodes to get  more Nodes in the vagrant file with the hardcode parameter N=2
